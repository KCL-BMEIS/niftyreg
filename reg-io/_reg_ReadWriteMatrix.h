 * affine parametrisation from Flirt (FSL package) and convert it

 * @param mat Structure that will be updated with the affine
 * transformation matrix
 * @param referenceImage Reference image of the current transformation
 * @param floatingImage Floating image of the current transformation.
 * Note that referenceImage and floating image have to be defined but
 * are only used when dealing with a Flirt affine matrix.
 * @param filename Filename for the text file that contains the matrix
 * to read
 * @param flirtFile If this flag is set to true the matrix is converted
 * from a Flirt (FSL) parametrisation to a standard parametrisation

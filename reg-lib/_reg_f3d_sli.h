/// @brief a class for Fast Free Form Deformation registration wiht sliding regions

/*
FFD registration that allows for two sliding regions, defined in the source image
a distance map (in the source image) must be provided, giving the distance to the 
sliding interface for all voxels, with voxels in region1 having negative values,
and voxels in region2 having positive values
The deformation in each region is represented by a separate B-spline transformation
and a penalty term is used to penalise gaps/overlaps between the two regions.
